Precious Password is a practical use app that is capable of taking a user defined password and to check if te password meets the requirements for

safe passwords.

You can use the live app [here](https://precious-password-2beae8772161.herokuapp.com/)

## USER STORIES

### USER GOALS (US1-PP3):

- As a user I want to know if my chosen password meets minimum requirements to be safe
- As a user I want to know if my password is included in breach data, so I can decide my next steps
- As a user I want to know if my password is commonly used, so I can avoid using it

## FEATURES
## DESIGN

There isn't not much design involved in this project. The main website uses the Code Institute PP3 template. However, there are some colors used in the app itself to add a better visual aid so the user can interpret the meaning of the messages displayed. The outputs were kept fairly simple using the color red for undesired output and the color green for desired output.

## TOOLS USED

### PREVIS

Wireframes are not involved here, but there is a flowchart for the general program flow

### CODING

The project was realized with the following tools:

- Visual Studio Code for writing and testing the code locally
- The python extension with autopep8 for Visual Studio Code
- The Code Institute PEP8 code validator for error scanning

### TECHNOLOGIES

The code was entirely written using Python 3.11.4 with the following libraries:

- hashlib for generating SHA-1 checksums
- requests for handling the GET-request to the pwned password api
- re for using regex incantations
- colorama for colorful terminal output
- pyfiglet for the ascii banner
- sleep() imported from time to add slight delays
- simple term menu for the interactive menu
